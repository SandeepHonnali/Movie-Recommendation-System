# Movie Recommendation System

This project implements a collaborative filtering recommendation system based on movie genres, using **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** for dimensionality reduction. The system recommends movies similar to a given title by calculating distances in the reduced PCA feature space of movie genres.

## Features:
- **Data Preprocessing**: One-hot encoding of movie genres to prepare data for PCA.
- **Recommendation System**: Uses Euclidean distance in PCA space to recommend similar movies based on a chosen title.
- **PCA Visualization**: Reduces feature dimensions to 2 for easy visualization and understanding of movie relationships.

## Technologies Used:
- **Python Libraries**: pandas, numpy, sklearn (PCA), matplotlib
- **Dataset**: Movie dataset containing movie titles and genre information.

## Results:
The system provides personalized movie recommendations based on genre similarity, enabling users to discover movies similar to the one they already like. The PCA visualization helps in understanding the clustering of movies in the genre space.
